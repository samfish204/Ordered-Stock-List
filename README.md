# Ordered-Stock-List
Takes in a text file of stocks given each stock symbol, name, closing date, closing price, and volume. Creates an ordered list of these stocks based off a comparator. Iterates through these ordered stocks and returns minimum price, total value on a specific day, and total value increase for a given stock.
